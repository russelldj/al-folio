I am currently spending a semester as a research assistant in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon, under the advisement of <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/martial-hebert/">Dr. Martial Hebert</a>. In spring I will return to Clarkson University to finish my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, and baring future semesters off I will be graduating in May 2020.

Currently most of my work is in computer vision, but I am interested in branching out into planning, control, and inteligent infastructure. I am looking for an internship for the summer of 2019 in either industry or academia. Additionally, I am happy to work on side projects during the semester, so if you have something you would like to collaborate on or a problem you'd like me to take a stab at, feel free to reach out to me by <a href="mailto:russelj@clarkson.edu"> email </a>

I also enjoy the outdoors and am somewhat competent at rowing, rock climbing, and skiing. This has made me interested in projects, technical or otherwise, with a an environmental focus.
