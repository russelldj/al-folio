While in high school I became very enemored with the idea of having a CNC machine to expand the range of things I could create. Given that I didn't have a lot of money I could put toward the project, I had to settle for low-cost materials so I made many of the structural parts from Baltic Birch or MDF. The system was fairly-traditional, with a fixed table and sliding gantries.
