I have just started this project, but it's something I've been toying with for about a year now. The idea is to implement limited perception, planning and control for my beat-up Subaru Outback so it can perform contrived tasks like a slalom race course. A (likely long-term) goal is to organize regular challenges where worldwide participants can submit their algorithms to run the car and compete for some performance metric. The code and more information about the technical ideas can be found on [Github](https://github.com/russelldj/FS2-self-driving).
