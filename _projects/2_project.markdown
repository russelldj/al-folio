This project hasn't really started yet, but it's something I've been toying with for about a year now. The idea is to implement limited perception, planning and control for my beat-up Outback so it can do limited tasks like a cone slalom course. A (likely long-term) goal is to organize regular challenges where worldwide participants can submit their algorithms to run the car. More information about the technical ideas can be found on [Github](https://github.com/russelldj/FS2-self-driving).
