Working with Microsoft Xbox Kinects has been a large part of my research with professors [Sean](http://www.seankbanerjee.com/) and [Natasha](http://www.natasha-banerjee.com/) Banerjee with [TARS](https://tars.clarkson.edu/) at Clarkson University. My main project was improving a hardware board which delivered timecode to the Kinect's microphones, therby robustly sychronizing them, and conducting experiements with the system. This work was published at the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) 2018 and I presented it in an oral conference. The paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8486445&tag=1) and this is the presentation: [PDF](/assets/ICME_presentation.pdf)/[PowerPoint](/assets/ICME_presentation.pptx).
