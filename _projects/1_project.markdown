This project is very much in it's early stage. The basic idea is to create a retrofit kit which can be placed in a car to alert them to dangerous situations on the road. 

The primary objectives would be detecting when the car is leaving the lane, when there is a pedestrian entering the road, or when when the driver is too close to a car in front. 

I have purchased a NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and plan to begin doing more work over winter break.
