In highschool a friend loaned me a longboard, a longer type of a skateboard which is often meant for commuting or going down hill. When it was time to return it, I realized I was enamored not only with the idea of owning one, but of making it myself. To make the first board I built a complex two-piece ribbed mold and pressed four layers of baltic brich until they held their shape. Then I cut it out on a bandsaw, sanded the numerout imperfections, and painted it.

This was a rather long and accident-prone proccess and the result wasn't terribly great, but I was hooked. I began spending much of my time making jigs and other accessories which made building further board more accurate, faster, and easier. This was epitomized by building a large-scale [CNC machine](../5_project), so I could design my boards and molds in simulation and precisely machine them. Over time, I also began experimenting with fiberglass and carbon fiber composites which are visually appealing and give the boards properties you can't get with solely wood. I ended up making about 25 boards and sold most of as the oddly-named [AVO boardshop](https://www.facebook.com/avoboardshop/). While it's been a while since I've made any boards it is something I would like to return to. If anyone would like to continue the bussiness, I am happy to offer you all of my materials and equipment at seriously-reduced or no cost.
